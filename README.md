# DevSecOps Playbook - Version 1.1 - July 2022
This playbook will help you introduce effective DevSecOps practices in your company, regardless of size. We provide explicit guidance and actionable steps to introduce security controls, measure their effectiveness, and demonstrate value for money to your business leaders. Following this playbook will help teams build materially more secure applications, and that in the end, is the intent.


## Some background

This playbook was inspired by several documents and I want to call them out here:

The "Minimum Viable Secure Product", or [MVSP](https://mvsp.dev) is a project that I have profound respect for. The MVSP is a great way to determine how mature an organization's security practices are.

Timo Pagel's amazing "DevSecOps Maturity Model" or [DSOMM](https://dsomm.timo-pagel.de/) is a project that I only found recently.  There is some overlap between the DSOMM and this document and you should definitely browse through the DSOMM and explore the different maturity levels.

## Shift Left

All companies and applications are unique. Blanket statements like "Shift Left" aren't helpful without context. Enterprises and startups have different tech stacks, funding, workforces, regulation, and more. Context matters, and this document provides a roadmap to use your context to determine your next DevSecOps destination.

We want to secure our applications, from cradle to grave. To do this, we have created five categories that cover the lifecycle of a software application. We've also added a Compliance Addendum for anyone that is interested in aligning with a specific compliance framework.

* [Development Environment](#development)
* [Source Code Management](#scm)
* [Continuous Improvement and Automation](#cicd)
* [Deployment](#deployment)
* [Organizational Techniques](#org)
* [Addendum: Compliance](#compliance)

## Priority and Difficulty explained

We use two rating systems:  **Priority** indicates the order you should implement controls and **Difficulty** indicates how hard implementation is for this control.

# The Checklist

<h2 id="development">Development Environment</h2>

The developer's laptop is where most of the magic happens, but also where most of the problems are introduced.  If you want to shift as far left as you can this is where you want to land much of your embedded security.

<h2 id="scm">Source code management (SCM)</h2>

Most companies now store their source code in cloud based repositories like GitHub, Bitbucket or Gitlab.  Even if you don't, you will use a centralized place for your software engineers to store their code.  Centralization and versioning means that these developers can work together without (mostly) stepping on each others toes.  Joe and Molly can both be working on the same component, file or function but their changes won't necessarily break the other one's changes. SCM is also a GREAT place to deploy security functions like server side git hooks and multi-factor authentication for your developers!

<h2 id="cicd">CI/CD Pipelines and Automation</h2>

Modern web applications are built using modern continuous integration and deployment processes.  This means that you run tests specific to whatever environment you are pushing to whether that's DEV, STAGING or PROD.

<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>

Applications are deployed somewhere whether that's an AWS Lambda, S3 bucket or some old crusty server in the corner of the server room.  In any case, DevSecOps best practices mean that you need to include that deployment location in your processes.

<h2 id="compliance">Compliance - Security Framework Reference Material</h2> 

Because this is meant to be a manifesto about how to do DevSecOps, we have to be cognizant that there are three groups of people that this affects: Developers, Operations and InfoSec.  Historically, there are many compliance frameworks that address the InfoSec community and to a lessor extent Operations teams.  But software development was never mentioned until only recently.  Understanding this, I wanted to note that most commonly there is only one section of a particular compliance framework that relates to software development. This is a list of the specific sections of several larger compliance frameworks that deal with software development specifically.

* NIST 800-53b SA 10, 11, 15, 16 and 17
* NIST 800-218 "Secure Software Development Framework"
* ISO 27001 Annex A Section 14
* CIS Section 16
* Australian ISM "Guidelines for Secure Development"

Below you will find links to several security frameworks that align with this document.  I have personally spent many years implementing CIS controls into my application environments.  CIS is a wonderful framework as its very prescriptive and easy for an engineer to understand.  This is not to say that CIS controls are easy to implement.  They are not!  Regardless, you can't deny the ubiquity of ISO27001 and SOC2 and I want this document to help orgs looking to meet those requirements as well.  In fact, SecureStack has started a SOC2 program and in parallel to writing this document I am busily mapping SOC2 requirements and will eventually add them to this document.

I had a number of Australian friends suggest that I tackle the Australian ISM and APRA CPS 234, so I've added both of these as well.  This is a work in progress and I encourage anyone that is interested to jump in and suggest mappings.  You can add an issue in GitHub or simply create a PR.

### CIS Critical Security Control 16: Application Software Security
The Center for Internet Security is an organization that has been providing very prescriptive security controls since 2000. There are a total of 18 security control groups with section 16 being the group we will be referencing for this document.  
https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/application-software-security

It's not the focus of this document, but CIS maintains an amazing set of benchmarks and build playbooks for most operating systems.  I have been using these templates for years and they are a great resource:  https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/

### Australian ISM 
The Australian Cyber Security Centre has authored a document called the "Information Security Manual" or ISM as its commonly called.  The landing page for this document is https://www.cyber.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-12/Information%20Security%20Manual%20%28December%202021%29.pdf.  

This document is large and has a very broad scope.  You can download the complete ISM at https://www.cyber.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-12/Information%20Security%20Manual%20%28December%202021%29.pdf

In late 2021 the ACSC released the "Guidelines for Software Development" (GSD).  These are a general set of guidelines for embedding secure coding practices into an organization. These guidelines are far from authoritative and are not very prescriptive with my favorite snippet from the GSD being this little gem: "Platform-specific secure programming practices are used when developing software, including using the lowest privilege needed to achieve a task, checking return values of all system calls, validating all inputs and encrypting all communications."  Is that a catch all or what?!  Wow!  Regardless, I am respectful of the energy that went into this set of guidelines and will continue to try and bring visibility to it as much as I personally can.

### APRA CPG 234
The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) is part of the Australian government and is charged with regulating the financial industry. It published the "Prudential Standard CPS 234" document in 2019 which outlines high level information security requirements. 

This document is organized in an unusual way with 8 "attachments" at the end of the doc.  It is in these attachments that the security controls and expectations are laid out.

### ISO27001 Annex A.14: System Acquisition, Development & Maintenance
ISO27001 is an international standard on how to manage information security. It measures the maturity of an organization with a total of 114 controls spread across 14 groupings. ISO27001 is built on the principle of gathering the documentation around these security controls in an information security management system (ISMS).

Group A.14 revolves around the acquisition and development of IT systems.  It is the only part of the ISO27001 specification that mentions specific
